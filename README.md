# What is Bulletproof Productions mission?

Bulletproof Productions mission statement is simple "Turning cents into Dollars ðŸ’°' for Artists with Killer Beats.".

Bulletproof Productions gives the power back in the hands of the artist and the fans so they both benefit from creating and enjoying the music they love. Basically, an artist doesn't need millions of fans to keep creating music to be a financially viable activity. All the artists need is 500 â€“ 1000 fans that really want to see them succeed and can support the artist directly. This is where Bulletproof Productions puts the artist and fans in direct contact to create this relationship.

A fan can personalize a track by recording onto an existing track from the artist and own that unique copy, at the same time the artist receives royalties because the fan used the artist's track. Now the fan can also get royalties if anyone uses the fan's unique copy.

# What is a Music NFT?

A music NFT, which stands for music non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset that can be traded on the blockchain which represents an audio-visual composition which can verify digital ownership.

# Why we need music audio NFTs?

Music / Audio NFTs turn the created art back into a commodity that can be owned like an old vinyl record, CD, cassette tape with a visual. The creator / producer of the music / audio can financially benefit from each sale of their creation.

Music NFTs allow fans to invest in artists that they enjoy and believe in, while receiving financial gains in return. Conversely, they allow artists to fund their music projects directly through the support of their fans. A win-win situation for both artists and fans. As opposed to the current dynamic where the artist receives pennies for thousands of streams, and the fans don't get to participate in the direct growth and support of their favorite artist.

One of the inherent benefits of a blockchain is the transparency of data ownership and data creation along with its accessibility not being able to be censored or discriminated or blocked. Anyone with an internet connection and digital funds can participate. This also solves the most part of the problems with Digital Rights Management (DRM).

# How to use Bulletproof Productions to raise funds from your community?

1. Mint a Blank Track with any audio content. Upload a file or use your microphone on your device.
2. Share your new NFT with your community.
3. Every time someone mints an NFT using your shared NFT you make royalties.
4. Connect with the same wallet in step 1 and click on Royalties to claim community royalties.

# Can I sell my Music NFT?

Yes! You can sell your Music NFT on any NFT marketplace or exchange.

Music NFTs can become a very lucrative investment as the track you minted gets more popular alongside the artists popularity and the fanbase increase.

Once you sell your Music NFT you can no longer claim royalties from it.
